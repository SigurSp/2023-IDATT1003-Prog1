Models contain the classes for the register and train departure.
Utils contains the util class.
Views contains the User interface class.
The main program is the TrainDispatchApp.

## How to run the project
To run the project open TrainDispatchApp and run the file. The program should then start in the terminal with instructions for the different menu options.

## How to run the tests
